Update 12/22/2020

Notedit, the original creator is busy with other things, and has given me maintainer/collaborator status on this project.

I am trying to meet a number of technical goals so I can use this package in a reliable way
in production environments.

I have decided to currently do most of this work here:
[https://github.com/cameronelliott/janus-go](https://github.com/cameronelliott/janus-go)

Please see if it suits your needs, and feel free to file PRs, issues and suggests there.

Thanks,
Cameron
